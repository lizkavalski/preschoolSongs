### Background
During the day I’m a paraeducator, almost like a teacher but without the paperwork or pay, for students who are developmental-delayed. At the school where I work there is a team of nine other teachers and paraeducators including myself. We use videos to show educational contents, stories, or songs to help expand student learning. Currently we are using software that is only on one computer and can’t be on the others. The other teacher has concerns with using google slides about privacy and people having access to the person's email when it opens. The problem with just going to youtube is students would get up and click on other videos or want to see other videos.

Solution: create a website that can host the videos, and view them. 

### Phase 1

In phase one of this website was to create a foundation for the website to grow. This means focusing on the user flow, which also includes the layout of each page. 

The user start with by picking a category, or theme. Once a category is picked they will pick a song realted to that category, in which will show a video of the song(or story). The user can choose to go back to the home page or back to the selected category from the video page.

### Phase 2 

In this phase the front-end to connected to a back-end, in which user can only GET infomation and use it.
